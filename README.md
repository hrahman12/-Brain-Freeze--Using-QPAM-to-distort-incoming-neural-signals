# “Brain Freeze” – Using QPAM to distort incoming neural signals
 
I took my main inspiration from this research conducted at CCRMA Stanford:

This project nvestigates the feasibility and implications of Quantum Phase Amplitude Modulation (QPAM) in altering neural transmission. This abstract outlines a theoretical framework where QPAM techniques could intentionally disrupt neural pathways, analogous to inducing temporary cognitive effects such as "brain freeze". Having this happen on trillions of neurons would be quite loud; however here we only use a few artificial neurons. The potential applications and ethical considerations of this approach in neuroscience and cognitive research are explored, suggesting new avenues for understanding neural dynamics and therapeutic interventions and even creating some cool backing sounds!

Since I have familiarity with both Qiskit and Pennylane (Another Quantum Programming Language but using Photonic Qubits) I just decided to use Pennylane due to the fact that in the future I will want to add some QML to automate it. I used Quantum Amplitude Encoding to extract and modify the data.
