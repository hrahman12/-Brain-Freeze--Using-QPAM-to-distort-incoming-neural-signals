# “Brain Freeze” – Using QPAM to distort incoming neural signals
 
I took my main inspiration from this research conducted at CCRMA Stanford: 
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265165122_Sonification_and_Visualization_of_Neural_Data
https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~mindyc/256a/final/

Here are some sample frequency distributions and array_data plots from my code
